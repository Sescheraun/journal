# journal
This will be my internship project and serve as a demonstration of my coding style to potential employers.

# Problem statement
There are a ton of blog sites out there with nearly every possible theme represented in both the subject matter and appearance.  The problem is, at least as I see it, that the user has no idea how secure the database is or what thier information is being used for.  Are they storing your password in plain text?  Are they selling your personal information?  Is the site run by off shore russian hackers?  The truth is that unless you write the program yourself, you just don't know.
