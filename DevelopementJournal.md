# Day 1
There is something that seems amusing about making a post in a journal agaout making a journal. 

This is a project is kind of a rebuild of an assignment from the first PHP class.  There we simply used php and mySql to cover the front and the back end.  This worked well enough for the purpous of learning to read and write from the data base with the tools we were learning at the time but for a live project that will end up online and being live.

# Day 2 (November 22 2018)
This past week brought an end to the group project in Enterprise Java and now I have two projects to finish by the end of the semester in the next four weeks.  I sit at my computer and collect my thoughts before I begin to code, and consider the question that always bugs me.  Do I start with the front of the back end?

They are both kind of needed to test the project but one has to be the starting poitn.  I think the best case is starting with the front end and stubbing out the curd object wo it will return something that will let the user know what method it got into.

# Day 3 and 4 (posted December 5 2018)
The first of the holidays this season really did proved to be rather relaasing.  I didn't get anything constructive done, but I do feel a little more relaxed.  the few weeks since then have been anything but,  I had some issues with my VM needing to be restored from a backup that proved to bbe ancient and did not have any of my previous work on this project.  Github had all the code, but I needed to rebuild the database and go some of the field names wrong.  I have, however got the server and the client speaking agian and now I am able to save new entries on the data base. (Yay level = Fluttershy)

# Day 6 (December 6)
I think I may be willing to call this version 0.9.  The basic functionality of the CURD model is all working as intended.  The interface needs a little more work and I want to ad some security so that only I can add, update or delete the postsand that will be version 1.0.

Future plans:  v 1.1: Search for posts by topic.  v n: Multiple users, implements conversation threads.
