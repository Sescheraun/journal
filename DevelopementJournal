# Day 1
There is something that seems amusing about making a post in a journal agaout making a journal. 

This is a project is kind of a rebuild of an assignment from the first PHP class.  There we simply used php and mySql to cover the front and the back end.  This worked well enough for the purpous of learning to read and write from the data base with the tools we were learning at the time but for a live project that will end up online and being live.
